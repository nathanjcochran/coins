# Coins

Solution to the coins problem presented [here](https://x.com/littmath/status/1834273354628424080):

> Flip 100 coins, labeled 1 through 100. Alice checks the coins in order (1, 2, 3, …) while Bob checks the odd-labeled coins, then the even-labeled ones (so 1, 3, 5, …, 99, 2, 4, 6, …). Who is more likely to see two heads *first*?
